# Layout

We use it to place everything on a screen within the Devo Platform.

<section className="mrow">
  <div className="mcol-12 mcol-sm-6">
It’s made up of different regions that define our Information Architecture. Each of them contains basic interaction, be it navigation, quick access to configurations, data sets, contents, etc.

Dalí also offers different components when generating layouts, consistently and systematically. Each of them should be used according to the context of use.

  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/layout-brand.png"
  />

  </div>
</section>

## UI regions

They represent the skeleton of the platform and the rest of the contents, components, navigations, etc. are placed on them. These areas are generated with the **“Grid”** component.

# Global region
## Global region
### Global region
#### Global region
##### Global region
##### Global region
The global region is reserved for the Devo sidebar and used as the main navigation within the platform.
### App header
The App header is reserved for the App bar and used as the first level navigation within a section. The App Bar can be replaced by specific Toolbars depending on the section (Data Search window, Activeboards, Flow). In these cases, the App bar options will be collapsed through a menu button on the right.
### Leading region
The leading region is primarily used for content navigation within a section that needs an additional level of depth.
### Main region 
The main region contains the main content of each section of the platform. Its internal structure is determined by a Fluid component.
