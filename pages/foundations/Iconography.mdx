# Iconography

Icons are visual symbols used to represent concepts, objects, actions, processes... etc. They allow a quick communication and draw attention to specific information.

<section className="mrow">
  <div className="mcol-12 mcol-sm-6">
    <p>
    We use an Icon Library called [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) as base. When we canâ€™t find there an icon which covers our needs, then we have to create a new one, but using as base an existing icon from the library with the same aspect ratio.
</p>
  </div>
  <div className="mcol-12 mcol-sm-6">
   <Figure>
  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/iconography-1x1.png"
  />
</Figure>
  </div>
</section>
## Icon sizes
We can apply a very wide range of colours to our icons depending on their parent components, context, status... etc. but we should use always a size included in this limited range:

<Figure>
  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/icons.png"
  />
</Figure>

## Use cases

<Figure>
  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/use-cases-iconography.jpg"
