# Content, voice and tone

Technical documentation should be concise and grammatically correct. It is written on a specific topic and is aimed at a specific reader. The main purpose of this document is to provide guidelines on how to make technical writing clear, concise, consistent and understandable for end users.

Those with a background in journalism will be familiar with the [Chicago style manual](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html).
This is an indispensable reference for all things grammar and syntax related, and
serves as our point of reference for all grammar-related pain points. However, it
isn't specific to the needs of technical writing so this document will include Devo-specific
style rules.

This guide covers the core principles of English writing, lists key grammar and punctuation rules, explains how to structure content to improve readability, and provides some useful pointers to make the process of technical writing easier.

It is aimed at all those who write or review texts in the interfaces of Devo products in the areas:

- Voice & Tone
- Language and grammar
- Glossary of action labels

## Voice & Tone

### 01. Introduction

<section className="mrow">
  <div className="mcol-12 mcol-sm-6">
    Devo's voice is how we communicate with users. When creating content it's
    important to consider not just what we say, but how we say it. Although our
    voice is consistent throughout all of our documentation, its tone adapts to
    each situation as well as the reader's expectations.
  </div>
  <div className="mcol-12 mcol-sm-6 mt-4">

Devo's voice is clear, informative, and relaxed. We use an informal style to write
content that is both simple and instructive. Check [this article](https://techwhirl.com/gender-neutral-technical-writing/)
for more information on keeping your writing and tone gender neutral.

| **Be concise (Less is more )** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; | Takes an existing object and uses it in a new context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Be human**                                                   | Even though this is technical documentation, avoid sounding like a robot. Read your text out loud and ask yourself if this is something a human would say. Also keep in mind that not all readers are experts on the given topic.<br/><em>Robotic: Invalid password.</em><br/><em>Human: Your password must contain a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.</em>                                        |
| **Be present**                                                 | Where possible, use the present tense and avoid using the past or future tense. This makes following procedures and instructions easier for readers and gives a sense of immediacy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Be direct<br/>/simple/clear**                                | This is not creative writing, but rather informative writing. Lead with important actions. The user wants to find information quickly. This allows the reader to scan the page for keywords.<br/>Most of the time, start each statement with a verb. Avoid using "you can" and "there is", "there are", "there were".                                                                                              |
| **Be inclusive**                                               | - Use the second-person pronoun (you, your, yours).<br/>- Do not use words that have gender-specific pairs (mankind, man hours).<br/>- Avoid phrases or words that could be misinterpreted or offend (blacklist/whitelist).<br/>- To avoid repetition it is acceptable to use the third-person pronoun they or replace he/she with the user.- Use the imperative mood (Do this, Close the window, Open a new tab). |

### 02. Abbreviations

Avoid using abbreviations where possible in your writing. This includes common abbreviations such as etc., e.g., and i.e. Instead, write out full words or choose phrases that explicitly explain the message you want to convey.

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<em>etc.</em>**
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<em>e.g.</em>**
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<em>i.e.</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<em>And so on</em>**
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<em>For example</em>**
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<em>Specifically or namely</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

### 03. Active and passive voice

Use the active voice to make your sentences direct and easy to read. The **active voice** conveys a strong and clear tone, while the **passive voice** is weaker.

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      **<em>A new password needs to be selected.</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      **<em>Select a new password.</em>**
      <br />
      <br />
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

With the **active voice**, the subject of the sentence does the action. With the
**passive voice**, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.

However, the **passive voice** is acceptable in the following situations:

- In an error message or troubleshooting content when the active subject is the user.
- The subject of the action is unknown, or you want to emphasize the object on which the action is performed.
- The sentence in active voice sounds unnatural or complicated.

### 04. Messaging guidelines

1. Write the error in clear, concise, and simple language. Avoid long sentences or ambiguous phrases.

   <section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
     <div className="col">
       <Figure type="dont" caption="">
         **
         <em>
           An error has occurred during the login process and you cannot log in
           to your account, please try again.
         </em>
         **
       </Figure>
     </div>
     <div className="col">
       <Figure type="do" caption="">
         **
         <em>Your password and/or username do not match. Please try again.</em>
         **
       </Figure>
     </div>
   </section>

2. Don’t blame the user.
   <section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
     <div className="col">
       <Figure type="dont" caption="">
         **<em>You didn’t enter an email address.</em>**
       </Figure>
     </div>
     <div className="col">
       <Figure type="do" caption="">
         **<em>Please enter an email address.</em>**
       </Figure>
     </div>
   </section>
3. Avoid negative words that undermine the user’s ability to follow instructions.
   <section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
     <div className="col">
       <Figure type="dont" caption="">
         **<em> The username you have entered contains errors.</em>**
       </Figure>
     </div>
     <div className="col">
       <Figure type="do" caption="">
         **<em>Please enter a valid username.</em>**
       </Figure>
     </div>
   </section>
4. Guide the user and offer suggestions to help resolve the issue.
   <section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
     <div className="col">
       <Figure type="dont" caption="">
         **<em>Enter a new name.</em>**
         <br />
       </Figure>
     </div>
     <div className="col">
       <Figure type="do" caption="">
         **
         <em>
           A domain with this name already exists. Please enter a new name.
         </em>
         **
       </Figure>
     </div>
   </section>
5. Avoid using all caps or upper case. This gives the impression of shouting at the user and is difficult to read.
   <section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
     <div className="col">
       <Figure type="dont" caption="">
         **<em> AN ERROR HAS OCCURRED. PLEASE TRY AGAIN.</em>**
       </Figure>
     </div>
     <div className="col">
       <Figure type="do" caption="">
         **<em>An error has occurred. Please try again.</em>**
       </Figure>
     </div>
   </section>

### 05. Modal verbs

Use modal verbs to express ideas such as ability, uncertainty, necessity and permission. Use modal verbs sparingly and at your discretion, and always use the correct verb for the instruction.

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      **
      <em>
        Avoid the modal verbs shall, might, would, and ought to in your writing.
      </em>
      **
    </Figure>
  </div>
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      **<em>Can:</em>** Relates to present ability and general possibility.
      <br />
      **<em>Could:</em>** Relates to possibility and suggestion.
      <br />
      **<em>May:</em>** Relates to probability and permission. It also means
      that an item is optional.
      <br />
      **<em>Need:</em>** Relates to the absence of obligation. In technical
      documentation, this verb is used only as a synonym for the verb want.
      <br />
      **<em>Must:</em>** Relates to personal obligation. It means that the
      definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
      <br />
      **<em>Have to:</em>** Relates to impersonal obligation. Don't use it as a
      synonym for the verb must.
      <br />
      **<em>Should:</em>** Relates to expectation and recommendation. Don't use
      it as a synonym for the verb must.
      <br />
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

## Language and grammar

The core function of the language and grammar used in technical and UX writing is to inform, as opposed to arguing or entertaining. Therefore, your writing should focus on providing straightforward and instructional statements that users can easily understand.

<section className="mrow">
  <div className="mcol-12 mcol-sm-6">
    Your writing should be consistent and concise, so that the user can follow
    prompts and steps without hesitation. Since the topic is instructional and
    often requires focused attention, longer sentences can lead to a higher
    potential for confusion. Short explanations are easier to understand.
  </div>
  <div className="mcol-12 mcol-sm-6 mt-4">
    <Figure>
      <img
        alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
        src="img/illustration-1.png"
      />
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

The same process applies to writing UI labels or commands. Remove superfluous words
and keep a consistent grammatical style throughout.

### 01. Bold

Use bold text formatting for static interface elements: buttons, tabs, links, options, check boxes, step names, and so forth. Do not use quotation marks to refer to these elements.

<Figure>
  <img
    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/Bold-2x.png"
  />
</Figure>

### 02. Capitalization

**Use sentence case**. That means only capitalizing the first word of a sentence, heading, title, UI label, tab, or standalone phrase. Sentence case makes it easier to differentiate between common and proper nouns.

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      **
      <em>
        In Data Search, The Tabs Would Be Explore Your Data, Search History,
        Query Management, And Lookup Management.
      </em>
      **
      <br />
    </Figure>
  </div>
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      **
      <em>
        In Data search, the tabs would be Explore your data, Search history,
        Query management, and Lookup management.
      </em>
      **
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

Exceptions to the sentence case rule are products and trademarks, which are written according to their stylization.

Do not use all caps (all uppercase) as this makes it difficult for the reader to differentiate between common and proper nouns.

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      **
      <em>
        USE THE CREDENTIALS CREATED HERE TO AUTHENTICATE REST API REQUESTS AND
        DEVO RELAY CONNECTIONS TO THE DEVO PLATFORM.
      </em>
      **
      <br />
    </Figure>
  </div>
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      **
      <em>
        Use the credentials created here to authenticate REST API requests and
        Devo Relay connections to the Devo Platform.
      </em>
      **
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

When writing about a UI element, always follow the same capitalization as used in the UI. For example, if referring to the **“Data search”** window you would be correct to write: “To run a search, you must access the data table where the events you need to work with are stored. You can do this via the **Data search** area in the navigation panel.”

The above rule applies to all UI elements including input forms, drop-down menus, and action labels.

### 03. Currency

Write the names of currencies in lowercase, but capitalize the reference to the country or region.

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
 Write the names of currencies in lowercase, but capitalize the reference to the country or region.

Note that the euro is not capitalized and do not make it plural.

  </div>
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<em>US dollar</em>**
      <br />

  </div>

</section>

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
    When referring to specific amounts of money in any currency, use the
    currency symbol on first reference followed by the amount with no spacing.
    Any further references use the currency symbol.

    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<em>USD450, then $450</em>**

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<em>JPY250, then ¥250</em>**
      <br />
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

### 04. Date & time

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
    **Dates** are written in the month–day–year order, with a comma before and
    after the year if it is not at the end of a sentence:

    </Figure>

    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<em>18:14</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

### 05. Gender

Use the **second-person pronou**n\*\* (you, your, yours) and avoid words that have gender pairs:

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">Use the imperative mood:</div>
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      **<em>"Choose a password and type it into the text box."</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

{' '}

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">Drop the pronoun whenever you can:</div>
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      **<em>"The user chooses a password and types it into the text box."</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

Replace gender-specific possessive pronouns with the:

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      **<em>"When the user types his password..."</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      **<em>"When the user types the password..."</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

### 06. Italics

Use italic text formatting for selectable interface elements (drop-down list options, object types) and input data you enter (object names, parameter names, parameter values, field values). Also, use italic formatting for error messages, section names if referencing an external document, and state and status names.

### 07. Links / Hyperlinks

When cross-referencing or linking to another article, include the link in the descriptive text.

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="dont" caption="">
      **<em>"Click here”</em>**
      <br />
      **<em>"More information here”</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
  <div className="col">
    <Figure type="do" caption="">
      **<em>"Read our documentation on LINQ queries"</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

### 08. Lists and procedures

**Bullet lists** do not necessarily need to go in order. They are a collection of items that have something in common but whose order is interchangeable:

- Use a period after every bullet that is a sentence.
- Don’t use a period after bullet lists that are not complete sentences or do not complete the opening stem sentence.
- Do not use semicolons to end punctuation.
- Use either all full sentences in your bullet lists or all fragments.
- Capitalize the first letter in each bullet.
- End the stem sentence with a colon.

**Numbered lists** are used for steps or processes and must go in chronological order.

- Use a period after every bullet that is a sentence.
- Don’t use a period after bullet lists that are not complete sentences or do not complete the opening stem sentence.
- Do not use semicolons to end punctuation.
- Use either all full sentences in your bullet lists or all fragments.
- Capitalize the first letter in each bullet.
- End the stem sentence with a colon.

For UI writing, if creating a list which is a series of radio buttons or boxes, do not use punctuation unless the items in the list are complete sentences. For both UI and technical writing, keep lists to a maximum of 10 items whenever possible as this makes it easier for the reader to scan.

### 09. Monospaced text

Use courier text formatting for anything that can be copy and pasted into a command line: URL paths, folder names, file names, and so forth.

### 10. Numbers

Generally, one to nine are written as words. Anything larger than nine should be written as a numeral (10, 11, and so on). Use commas to separate thousand units: 1,000.

Exceptions to the above are:

- When starting a sentence avoid using numerals.
- In the same sentence as higher numbers.
- In headings, buttons, and wherever space is very limited (not subheadings).
- In version numbers, dates, and times.
- Abbreviated units of measurement.
- Percentages.

    <div className="col">
      <Figure type="dont" caption="">
        **<em>"The category length cant be more than six characters." </em>**

      <Figure type="do" caption="">
        **<em>"The category length cant be more than 6 characters."</em>**
      </Figure>
    </div>
  </section>

### 11. Plurals

To form the plural of an abbreviation, an acronym, or a number, add a lowercase s without an apostrophe. If an acronym already represents a plural noun, do not add an s.

<Figure type="do" caption="">
  **<em>CPUs, APIs, IDs, OSs, the 1990s, 0s, and 1s</em>**
  <br />
  **<em>FAQ: frequently asked questions</em>**
</Figure>

To form the plural of a single letter or a symbol, add an apostrophe and a lowercases.

<Figure type="do" caption="">
  **<em>x’s, #’s</em>**
</Figure>

Abbreviated units of measure are both singular and plural; no s is necessary.

<Figure type="do" caption="">
  **<em>5 mm, 20 min</em>**
</Figure>

Do not use (s), /s, (es), or /es at the end of a word to indicate the possibility
of more than one item, and do not combine the singular and plural forms of a verb,
such as is/are.

Avoid using gender-specific third-person pronouns (he, she).

### 15. Punctuation

Punctuation is used to structure and organize content. It provides the reader with vital clues to understand the meaning of a text. Proper punctuation is also an important tool to make your written work logical and readable. Even a small comma can greatly change the meaning of the sentence.

The more punctuation you add, the more complex a sentence becomes. If a sentence contains more than two commas and ending punctuation, consider rewriting it.

#### Apostrophes

#### Colons and semicolons

##### Colons

A colon provides an explanation to the information you have just mentioned. A semicolon indicates a brief pause that is slightly longer than that of a comma.

<ins>Use a colon:</ins>

- At the end of a sentence that directly introduces a list.
- Sparingly at the end of a statement followed by a second statement that expands on it. Most of the time, two sentences are easier to read.

When you use a colon in a sentence, lowercase the word that follows it unless:

- The colon introduces a direct quotation.
- The first word after the colon is a proper noun.

When you use a colon in a title or heading, capitalize the word that directly follows it.

##### Semicolons

Sentences that contain semicolons are often difficult to read. Try to simplify the sentence by breaking it into multiple sentences or a list.

<ins>Use semicolons:</ins>- Between two independent clauses that are not joined
by a conjunction. - Between contrasting statements that are not joined by a
conjunction. - To separate items in a series that contains commas or other
punctuation. In this case it is usually better to break it down into a list as
it scans better.

<section className="mrow">

  <div className="mcol-12 mcol-sm-6">

</div>
</section>

#### Commas

While a period ends a sentence, a comma indicates a brief pause.

**<ins>Use a comma:</ins>**

- Before the conjunction in a list of three or more items. This is known as the Oxford Comma.
- Following an introductory phrase.
- In a series of two or more adjectives that precede a noun when their order is interchangeable.
- To separate conjunctive adverbs (in addition, also, on the other hand, however, moreover, furthermore, for example, finally).

Here is a full list of conjunctive adverbs:

{' '}

<Figure>

    alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"
    src="img/adverbs-15x.png"
  />
</Figure>
**<ins>Don’t use a comma:</ins>** - To join independent clauses when you do not use
a conjunction. Use a semicolon instead. - Between two verbs that apply to the same
subject. - Between the month and the year when a specific date is not mentioned.

#### Contractions

Contractions convey a warm and friendly tone, but they can be confusing for non-native readers. For this reason it is best to avoid them. A contraction indicates that one word should be written as two words.

#### Dashes and hyphens

Dashes and hyphens are not interchangeable. Keep the following in mind:

- Em dashes (—) set off or emphasize parenthetical phrases.
- En dashes (–) are used in number and date ranges, in negative numbers, and as a minus sign.
- Hyphens (-) are used to join words and connect prefixes to stem words. Do not use two hyphens in place of an em dash.

Do not use spaces before or after em and en dashes.

#### Ellipses

Avoid using an ellipsis (…) except to indicate omitted code in technical content.

#### Exclamation points/marks

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
    Exclamation points should not be used. In the unusual case of it being
    appropriate to use one, never end a sentence with more than one exclamation
    point.
  </div>

      **<em>Does that apply to question marks, too?????</em>**
      <br />
      **<em>Yes!!!!!!!</em>**
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

#### Periods (full stops)

Do not use periods in headings, subheadings, UI titles, UI text, or simple lists (three or fewer words per item).

End all sentences with a period. Put one space after a period.

When a phrase ending with a colon introduces a bulleted list:

- If one or more list elements complete the introductory phrase preceding the colon, use a period after every list element.
- If all list elements are short phrases (three words or fewer), do not end them with periods, even if they form a complete sentence together with the list introduction.
- If one or more list elements are complete sentences, use a period after every element, even if a list element contains three or fewer words.

#### Question marks

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
  <div className="col">
  The reader is looking for an answer, not a question, so use them sparingly.

However, it is acceptable to use a question mark when the user needs to make a decision.

  </div>
  <div className="col">
      <Figure

     **<em>Do you want to save your changes?</em>**<br/>
    **<em>Do you want to shut down the system?</em>**
      </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

#### Quotation marks

Limit the use of quotations to direct quotes as they give a busy look to the text. When necessary, use double quotation marks (" ") instead of single quotation marks (' ').

Place closing quotation marks:

- Outside commas and periods.
- Inside other punctuation.

#### Slashes

When you instruct users to enter a slash, include the spelled-out term first, followed by the symbol in parentheses.

Use a slash for combinations. Capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized. In the case of in-app features or parts, capitalize both.

Don't use a slash as a substitute for or. If the UI uses a slash in this way, follow the interface in describing the label, but use or to describe the action in writing.

### 16. Titles and headings

Headings allow readers to easily scan content by offering structure and reference points. It is important that headings are used consistently; it usually suffices to have one or two heading levels in any given article.

- Keep headings as short as possible, and lead in with the most important idea.
- Be as specific as possible, becoming even more detailed with lower-level headings.
- Focus on what users can achieve or what they need to know about a feature.

  <section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
    <div className="col">
      - Use noun phrases for first-level headings, verb phrases for second-level
      headings, and infinitive phrases for headings in instructions.
    </div>
    <div className="col">
      <Figure type="do" caption="">

        </em>
        **
      </Figure>
    </div>
  </section>

- Use sentence-style capitalization for headings. That means that you capitalize the first word, any proper nouns, and the first word after a colon (if there is one).
  <section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">
    <div className="col">
      - Don't end headings with a period. Use your own judgement if a question
      mark is needed in certain cases:
    </div>
    <div className="col">
      <Figure type="do" caption="">
        **1. What can we help you find?**
        <br />
        **2. Are you sure you want to end the session?**
      </Figure>
    </div>
  </section>

Use italic if it would be required in body text.

- Keep hyphenated words and multiple-word proper nouns on the same line.
- If a heading is longer than two lines, consider rewriting it.
- Do not use ampersands (&) or plus signs (+) in headings unless you're referring to UI that contains them or space is limited.
- Avoid hyphens in headings if possible.

<section className="row gy-4 row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-2 margin-top--lg">

## Glossary of action labels

Using the right words for action labels is important if you want to make your product user-friendly. Consistent and precise labelling gives users clarity and motivation to take the right action.

<section className="mrow">
  <div className="mcol-12 mcol-sm-6">
    Action labels are the middlemen between your product and its users, any
    confusion or hesitation could lead to dissatisfaction on the users’ behalf,
    which in turn could lead to frustration and poor user experience.
  </div>
  <div className="mcol-12 mcol-sm-6 mt-4">
    <Figure>
      <img
        alt="Location of the 'status' icon button in a widget header"

      />
    </Figure>
  </div>
</section>

Here are some tips to keep in mind when creating top-notch action labels:

**1. Call to action.**

Action labels should always inspire users to do just that: take action. When users read an action verb, they know what the button will do. The user can perform the action without needing to read the dialog box or any supporting text. Action buttons such as ‘Yes/No’ are vague and force users to read more to understand the result of their actions.

**2. Be concise.**

Use the imperative form in an active voice. This reduces the number of words and makes the action label easier to scan. Words like ‘a’ and ‘the’ aren’t necessary for the user to complete an action, so remove them from your labels.

**3. Use language that lets the user know the end result of the action.**

Vague or generic action labels can cause uncertainty for users because they aren’t sure what the result of the action will be. If users are unsure of the result of clicking on an action label, there is a chance they will make errors, leading to user dissatisfaction.

| Action &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; | Explanation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;                                                                          |

| **Add**                           | Takes an existing object and uses it in a new context.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Apply**                         | Saves changes without closing the dialog.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Cancel**                        | Stops the current action and closes the dialog. Warn the user of any possible negative consequences of stopping an action from progressing.                                                                            |
| **Clear**                         | This action clears all the fields or selections. Where appropriate, combine Clear with the object (Clear fields or Clear all).                                                                                         |

| **Close**                         | Closes the current page or window. Do not use Close alongside OK or Cancel actions.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Delete**                        | Destroys an existing object.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Edit**                          | Allows data or values to be modified. Edit does not always imply the object is automatically updated, the user usually has to save the changes.                                                                        |

| \*\*Manage                        | Modifies existing object settings or options.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **New**                           | Starts the creation of a new object. New either creates the object immediately or opens a dialog or set of fields where the user can enter properties. Combine New with the object to create (New user or New column). |
| **Refresh**                       | Reloads the view of an object when the displayed view has become unsynchronized with the source.                                                                                                                       |
| **Remov**                         | Removes an object from the current context but the object is not destroyed as a result of the action.                                                                                                                  |
