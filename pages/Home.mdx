# Genesys Design System

Genesys is Devo's design system for products and digital ecosystems and home
to the foundations, human interface guidelines, design tools, UI components and
interaction patterns that we use to build great experiences.

(PENDING): The TOC menu has to be removed from this story.

A design system is a collection of pre-built, reusable assetsâ€”components,
patterns, guidance, and codeâ€”that allows its users to build consistent digital
experiences faster. By using the pre-built and universal assets of DalÃ­, the
time teams spend designing and building is minimized. Instead of building and
re-building basic elements, they can spend that time customizing their products
to address specific client use cases.

## Resources

Devo maintains this design kit in Figma, containing DalÃ­ components. We support
React framework implementation through the component library called Coco.
