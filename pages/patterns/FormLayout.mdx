# Form layout

The definition of spacing and sizing patterns to distribute and group form fields

How the form fields are grouped and distributed is especially important for users to
understand the relations and dependencies between those fields. In addition, the size
of each form control helps users to realize the nature and length of the expected data.

## Distribution

The way the form fields will be distributed will be by default in one column, placing
the fields one below the other. This facilitates the reading order and avoids the user
having to follow the 'Z pattern' (zig-zag reading). In this way, it is easier to complete
each of the fields.

The exception for using horizontal distribution with only one field for each row
is when we are working with related fields, and they don’t need too much space
to get their data filled, when we are working with the definition of entities
with a limited number of fields or with combined fields:

## Groups

When we find a set of related fields we will try to group them. Even if the relationship
is not very strong, a group will always be useful so that a long form does not seem so
heavy to fill out for the user.

The visual solution for grouping fields is the combined use of a header and a grouping
box with a padding of 'cmp-md' (16px) on all its sides, except for the upper one, which
as visual compensation is used the lower step 'cmp-sm '(12px).

If we need to define subgroups within other groups the solution is exactly the same:

    alt="Form sub-group example"
  />
</Figure>

Sometimes we find that in a form there are several groups, but one of them only
contains one field. The solution is to use the form field with the hidden label
and replace it with the same header that is used in the groups, with the same
separation, although it is slightly higher than the one that the label would have:

## Sizing

The sizing type of form fields are defined by the context of the form. If the
distribution of the fields is horizontal in a row or vertical in a column.

### Horizontal distribution: percentual

In the first case, the width of each one is defined by its parent container
and the unit is percentual.The form fields should fill the entire available
width and its percentage has to be related with the nature and length of its
expected data.

### Vertical distribution: absolute

In the second case, the width of each field is only defined by the nature and
length of its expected data. There are several predefined widths based in a
minimum 60px width column and a 16px gutter.

The exception is when we expect a large length for the data, or we don’t know
what it will be; then we use a 100% size for the field.

## Spacing

The form spacing system is oriented towards simplicity. It’s based in the strength
of the relation between the elements and the type of distribution applied to them.

### Space between fields

The space between fields will be in almost any case ‘cmp-md’ (16px, 1rem or 1.6rem in base 10).

  alt="Spacing between fields"
/>

But when we are working with a horizontal distribution and the relation between
the fields is very strong we can use ‘cmp-sm’ (12px, 0.75rem or 1.2rem in base 10).

### Spacing with groups

The spacing with form groups is always ‘cmp-lg’ (24px, 1.5rem or 2.4rem in base 10).
We’re talking about the space between groups (nested or not) and between fields and
groups. The spacing between the form and the buttons block is the same.

The spacing between the form group heading and the group (or the field) is
always ‘cmp-xs’ (8px, 0.5rem or 0.8rem in base 10).
