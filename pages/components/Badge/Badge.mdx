attribute indicates what notifications the user agent will trigger when the [accessibility tree](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree)
within a live region is modified.

### aria-atomic

In ARIA live regions, the global [aria-atomic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-atomic)
attribute indicates whether assistive technologies such as a screen reader
will present all, or only parts of, the changed region based on the change
notifications defined by the [aria-relevant](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-relevant)
attribute.

### aria-live

The global [aria-live](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-live)
attribute indicates that an element will be updated, and describes the types of
updates the user agents, assistive technologies, and user can expect from the
live region.
