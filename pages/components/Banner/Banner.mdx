# Banner

The Banner component provides to the users the messages about:

- Explicit information for/complete a configuration or process (info, help, etc.).
- Warning for a form's fields group validation.

Both persist until the problem described is solved, but only the context banner type can be closed by the user.

Banners can contain several messages on the same banner (for example a summary of errors within a form). In addition, they can include further actions.

## Overview

### Variants

Each banner variant has a particular function and its design signals that function to the user. It is therefore very important that the different variants are implemented consistently across products, so that they message the correct actions.

## Accessibility

Recommended attributes to be included:

### aria-live

Dynamic content which updates without a page reload.
Live regions need to exist in the HTML at time of page-load, but they will only
be announced when the content within the container changes.
Used in the `.box-message` block.

### role

The status role defines an advisory that is not important enough to be an alert.
Used in the `.box-message` block.

Only one of the two attributes (aria-label or role) can be used at the same time:

- `<div aria-live="polite">` is analogous to `<div role="status">`.
- `<div aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true">` is analogous to `<div role="alert">`.

Used in the `.box-message` block as:

- `aria-live="polite"` or `role="status"`: It is used to display a message to
  the user in a way that does not interrupt the user’s current task and queues the
  notification until whatever task the user is currently working on is complete.
- `aria-live="assertive"` or `role="alert"`: If the notification contains an
  urgent message. It is used to display a message to the user that interrupts the
  user’s current task. These are considerably more disruptive to users than the
  `role="status"`.

### aria-label

A more descriptive explanation for screen readers.
Used in the `.box-message__remove-button` button element as `aria-label="close"`.
