## Overview
The App Bar displays navigation and key actions.

### Variants

Drilling down into the components'  tree, it is possible to switch the number of tabs and colorScheme of each one. Is expected that the main App Bar always uses the size 'lg' of Tabs and never has any of the closable options.

The App Bar is composed by three areas:

- On the left is the main page/section name.
- The next area o the left, separated with a divider, is the main navigation with the subsections of the page.
- On the right of the App Bar there are some main actions and the user options separated with another divider.
