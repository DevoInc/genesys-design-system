# Chip group

The Controlled Chip Group component filters the information represented as a logical operator. The chips in this group are related and visually connected to each other. It usually always appears with a label.

## Overview

The Controlled Chip Group (CCG) contains two or more chips. A label component should be included when the own chips are not clear semantically by themselves.
The following variants are available: 

- **Type**: filter or choice. Use the filter variant when multiple chips could be selected, whereas in the choice variant, only one of the chips is selected.
- **Label**: left, top, none. Label positioning in relation to chips.
- **Size**: xs, sm, md, lg
- **Default value**: (True/False) boolean. A chip status is selected as a predefined value.

## Anatomy

The Chip Group always displays multiple chips in an horizontal x-axis and packed to the left. The label component can be present in a left or top position in relation to the chips.

Space between chips is always fixed. In case of a CCG is contained by a parent component, this spacing will remain fixed and never distributed. However, the parent component width will be itâ€™s own max-width. If a chip is not fitting the chip will be placed in a new line underneath, as the CCG behaves as a wrap component.

Spacing between the label component and chips is fixed no matter the CCG own size.
